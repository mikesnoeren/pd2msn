# About mikesnoeren/craft

This repository was created to provide an easy starting point for your new [Craft CMS 3](https://github.com/craftcms/cms) projects.

Please be aware that this project is very opinionated; it expects you to mostly be using [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for the frontend. 
If you do require custom JavaScript or CSS, it will be bundled, transformed and minified using [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) and [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss).
